<h2>Decentralized Processing</h2>
<p>There are more to smart contracts than just tokens. Aquachain is a distributed computing platform
based on <strong>proof-of-work</strong> chain technology. Its not a company, and there was no ICO,
no pre-mine, no dev fund, no pre-sale, etc. Transactions, once mined, are
<strong>irreversible and uncensorable</strong>. Aquachain is the blockchain, AQUA is the
fuel. You need AQUA to create and interact with executable distributed code contracts, and to send transactions.

To learn more, see the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/aquachain/aquachain/wikis/Basics">wiki</a>. To get some AQUA,
the best way is to mine it yourself. You can join a mining pool (listed below) to earn a
percentage of a block reward, determined by your shares.
